## Training using tf.keras on GPU

This directory contains noteboooks and code for DL training steps of the pipeline.  
This shows a few examples and methods deploying TensorFlow/Keras for training using GPU + 
code for integrating with Apache Spark and data conversion code from Apache Parquet to TFRecord.

**Note:** see also [Training_TFKeras_CPU_GPU_K8S_Distributed](../Training_TFKeras_CPU_GPU_K8S_Distributed) for
distributed training on Kubernets clusters, using the custom TF-Spawner tool.
