## Training ML classifiers using Spark 

This is part of the work: Machine Learning Pipelines with Modern Big Data Tools for High Energy Physics Comput Softw Big Sci 4, 8 (2020).  
This directory contains notebooks and code for model training using Spark to parallelize ML, and in particular the High Level particle Classifier. 

The techniques tested include:
- [Spark ML Random forest](4.0a-Training-HLF-RandomForestClassifier.ipynb)
- [Spark parallelizing XGBoost](4.0b-Training-HLF-XGBoostClassifier.ipynb)
- [Spark parallelizing lightGBM](4.0c-Training-HLF_LightGBM.ipynb)
